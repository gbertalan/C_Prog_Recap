# Compiling C Code

<br>

### "Hello, world!"

<blockquote>

<h5 a><strong><code>hello.c:</code></strong></h5>

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  printf("Hello, world!\n");
  return 0;
}
```

</blockquote>
  
<br>

### Basic Compilation

<blockquote>

```
gcc hello.c -o hello_world.out
```

</blockquote>

<br>

### Running Your Program

<blockquote>

```
./hello_world.out
```

</blockquote>

<br>

### Compiling Multiple Files

<blockquote>

```
gcc main.c main2.c main3.c -o output_file.out
```

When *header files* are used, those don't need to be included in the compilation command, those are included inside the c source files via the **#include** *preprocessor directive*.

### Compilation Options

<blockquote>

#### Some Useful Options

- **Wall**: This option enables all warnings. This is a good option to use because it will help you to find potential errors in your code.
- **Wextra**: This option enables additional warnings that are not enabled by default. This is a good option to use if you are experienced with C and want to be extra careful.
- **pedantic**: This option enables all warnings, even those that are considered to be "pedantic". This is a good option to use if you are writing code that will be used in a critical application.
- **pedantic-errors**: same as the previous, but gives errors instead of warnings.
- **Werror**: This option turns all warnings into errors. This is a good option to use if you want to be sure that your code is free of errors.
- **O3**: This option optimizes the code for speed. This is a good option to use if you are concerned about the performance of your code.
- **g**: This option adds debugging information to the code. This is a good option to use if you are debugging your code.

E.g.:

```
gcc hello.c -pedantic -o hello_world.out
```

<br>

#### Option Order

In some cases the order of the options can matter. For example with the -O options:

```
gcc -O2 -O3 hello.c
gcc -O3 -O2 hello.c
```

### Debugging

<blockquote>

1. Compile with the -g option (e.g. `gcc hello.c -g -o hello_world.out`).
2. Run gdb with `gdb hello_world.out` from the command line.
3. Set breakpoint with *b*, e.g. `b 5` to line 5.
4. Run the program with gdb by typing `r`.
5. Inspect the state of your program:
   - `print <variable>` prints the value of the variable
   - `backtrace` shows the current callstack
   - `step` steps through the code line by line. If there is a function, it will step *into* that function. 
   - `stepi`steps through the code instruction by instruction. (So it is lower level than *step*)
   - `next` steps through the code line by line. If there is a function, it will step *over* that function. 
   - `continue` runs the program until the next breakpoint
6. Quits the program with `q`
